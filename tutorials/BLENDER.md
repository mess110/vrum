## Exporting from Blender

To export to glTF, the recommended format by three.js, you need to install the
[glTF-Blender-Exporter](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter)
blender addon.

* [Download the exporter](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter/archive/master.zip)
* unzip `scripts/addons/io_scene_gltf2` to `~/.config/blender/VERSION/scripts/addons/`
* enable the addon from Blender User Preferences
* export to glb as it packs all the resources in 1 file
